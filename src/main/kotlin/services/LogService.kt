/**
 * PersistentStateComponent implementation.
 *
 * The [loadState] method is called by IDEA after the component has been created (only if there is some non-default
 * state persisted for the component), and after the XML file with the persisted state is changed externally (for
 * example, if the project file was updated from the version control system). In the latter case, the component is
 * responsible for updating the UI and other related components according to the changed state.
 *
 * The [getState] method is called by IDEA every time the settings are saved (for example, on frame deactivation or
 * when closing the IDE). If the state returned from [getState] is equal to the default state (obtained by creating
 * the state class with a default constructor), nothing is persisted in the XML. Otherwise, the returned state is
 * serialized in XML and stored.
